2 tests script : 


testscript.sh :

	to launch : ./testscript.sh [testfile] [addressfile]

		exemple of tests files are : testWifi1hop, testlbardonehop, testlbardmultihop

		This script can be ameliorate, as used for the firsts tests and not really after we discovered the lbard problems
		Wifi capture can be not so good as there is still problems with the mesh observer

spreadTest.sh :

	to launch : ./spreadTest.sh

		No need for argument but in file it's needed to specify a .tar file with a rhizome database

		This tests loop a certain amount of time (written in the tests script), and tests is database is correctly spread on all mesh extenders after a certain time. To do so, it will sent txt file in repository rhizometest at 192.168.1.41. (computer in lab)
